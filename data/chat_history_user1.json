Here's what I can tell you:\n\nWhen you want to rest your knee while watching TV, it's a good idea to elevate your knee and keep it straight. You can use a pillow or cushion to prop up your knee and keep it at a comfortable height. This can help reduce swelling and promote healing.\n\nYou can also consider using a recliner or a comfortable chair with a footrest to support your knee and make it easier to relax while watching TV.\n\nRemember to follow the advice of your healthcare team and take regular breaks to rest and move around. This can help prevent stiffness and promote a smooth recovery.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."

Here's what I can tell you:\n\nIt's generally recommended to avoid bending or stretching your knee too much in the early stages of recovery. However, gentle exercises and stretches can help with your recovery. Your physiotherapist or occupational therapist will provide you with specific exercises and advice on how to safely stretch and strengthen your knee.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some gentle movements while sitting or lying down, such as straightening and bending your knee while keeping your foot flat on the floor. However, it's essential to follow the advice of your healthcare team and avoid any exercises that cause pain or discomfort.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."
