Here's what I can tell you:\n\nAccording to your NHS guidelines, it's generally recommended to use crutches or walking sticks at first after a knee replacement. This is to help you get around safely and avoid putting too much strain on your new knee.\n\n- You'll need to use crutches or walking sticks for a while, but you can gradually reduce the number of supports as you become more confident.\n- It's best to follow the advice of your hospital staff and physiotherapist on when it's safe to start walking without supports.\n- For now, it's probably best to stick to short, gentle walks with the help of crutches or walking sticks.\n\nPlease remember to follow your hospital's advice and listen to your body - if you're feeling tired or experiencing any pain, it's best to take it easy. If you have any doubts or concerns, don't hesitate to ask."
